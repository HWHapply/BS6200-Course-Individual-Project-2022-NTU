# The hospital mortality prediction for ICUadmitted HF (Heart Failure) patients using MIMIC III dataset

## Abstract:
MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)
comprises information relating to patients admitted to Intensive
care units at a large tertiary care hospital. It covers 38,597 distinct
adult patients and 49,785 hospital admissions between 2001 and
2012.

The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units 
2 (ICU)-admitted HF patients remain poorly characterized. This
project is aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for allcause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients. Try to find the features that associate with the hospital mortality of HF.

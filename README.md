# The hospital mortality prediction for ICU admitted HF (Heart Failure) patients using MIMIC III dataset

## Abstract:
HF is a chronic disease that worsens over time, causing
progressive remodeling of the heart. It is a complex clinical syndrome that causes a
patient's heart to not pump enough blood (ventricular insufficiency)
to meet the oxygen needs of vital organs and tissues in the body.
The result is the accumulation of fluid in the lungs and/or various
parts of the body, resulting in congestion and edema. 

MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)
comprises information relating to patients admitted to Intensive
care units at a large tertiary care hospital. It covers 38,597 distinct
adult patients and 49,785 hospital admissions between 2001 and
2012.

The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units 
2 (ICU)-admitted HF patients remain poorly characterized. This
project is aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for allcause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients. Try to find the features that associate with the hospital mortality of HF.
